For our APIs, we utilized three.

The weather API, Dark Sky, shows the current conditions outside as well as well as the weather over a six-day period. We also gave users the option to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, depending on whoâ€™s utilizing the app.

The event API, Eventful, which we altered to only focus on the New York City metropolitan area within 25 miles from the borough of Manhattan.

As for the location API, we used Geolocation & Google.
